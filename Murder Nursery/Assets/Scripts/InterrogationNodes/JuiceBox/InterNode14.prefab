  speech: "INTERROGATION EVIDENCE RECIEVED:  Whew, I better let this guy take a breather.
    Looks like our inspired artist relies on a little more than just creative juices...
    and Scarlet is the one feeding his little addiction! What could be her motive?
    Speaking of motive - howsabout little Gracie and JB being pals after all? Or
    so he says. Why would Chase be so keen on keeping him away from the ladies? Is
    he just greedy, or is there something to these rumours about JB? Guess Juice
    Box is quite the artist after all... he's painting a real picture that this nursery
    ain't all it seems to be.   INTERROGATION EVIDENCE RECIEVED:  \LWhew, I better
