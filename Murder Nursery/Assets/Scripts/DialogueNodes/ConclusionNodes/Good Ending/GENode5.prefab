  speech: Well... who's to say? Maybe I had help, maybe I <shake>didn't</shake>.
    But one thing's for sure, you caught me fair and square, and I know when the
    cat's outta the bag. Figured it was real easy to make out like Scarlet took her
    jealousy a step too far and finally put the <shake>squeeze</shake> on Grace.
    Maybe then I'd get the chance to go talk to her a little, share a cookie, watch
    some cartoons - I mean, grown-up movies. Honestly though, I woulda made out like
    it was anybody but me by the end, detective. Ya really know how to make a guy
    <wiggle>sweat</wiggle>!
  responses:
  - I thought we were besties! I'm hurt, CG. Wounded. I think you owe us all a reaaal
    big apology, kid.
  - And here I was thinkin' we were all friends! I think you  owe us all a biiiiig
    apology, bucko.
  - I expected better, even from you. I think you owe everyone here a real big apology.
    Come on, spit it out!
